x Sensor architecture
x Accelerometer
x Gyroscope
x Rendering put into OpenGLPipeline class
x Drawing dummy shapes without lighting

x Drawing global coordinate system + grid
x Shadow filtering to improve borders
x Material shading
x New ambient occlusion algorithm - SAO (+ edge-aware blur)
x Revolute joint damping
x Replaced Bullet motors with direct force/torque (it was blowing up!)
x Optimized, fast text rendering -> FTGL exchanged for OGLFT (true-type fonts through Freetype2)
x Adaptive shadow sampling with spiral sample pattern (high precision sampling only for the borders of shadows)
x Setting arbitrary physical properties for simple solid entities
